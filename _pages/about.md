üëãüèº My name is Nihar Paul and I am a Postdoctoral Investigator at the [Department of Physical Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts, US](https://www.whoi.edu/). My research interests are understanding the processes involved in the dynamics of mesoscale eddies, application of non-linear dynamics in the context of geophysical flows, air-sea interaction processes, submesoscale flows and internal waves, shallow-water equations, rotating and stratified turbulence, ocean modeling, and machine learning. I am working under the supervision of senior scientist [Dr. J. Thomas Farrar](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/jfarrar/) on tropical waves and moored measurements beginning January 2025. Before that, I worked with senior scientist [Dr. Amala Mahadevan](https://mahadevan.whoi.edu/) on understanding vertical transport driven by Near-inertial waves in a submesoscale front using observation and process study modelling.
