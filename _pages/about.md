My name is Nihar Paul and I am a postdoctoral investigator at the [Department of Physical Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts](https://www.whoi.edu/). My research interests are understanding the processes involved in the dynamics of mesoscale eddies, application of non-linear dynamics in the context of geophysical flows, air-sea interaction processes, submesoscale flows and internal waves, shallow-water equations, rotating and stratified turbulence, and ocean modeling. I am working under the supervision of senior scientist [Dr. J. Thomas Farrar](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/jfarrar/) beginning January 2025. Before that, I worked with senior scientist [Dr. Amala Mahadevan](https://mahadevan.whoi.edu/) on understanding vertical transport driven by Near-inertial waves in a submesoscale front using observation and process study modelling.

Prior to joining WHOI, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India](https://ae.iitm.ac.in/), with Professor[Manikandan Mathur](https://sites.google.com/site/mathur2m/home). The area of research dealt with Lagrangian coherent structures and internal waves. 

I completed my Ph.D. in September 2022 from the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/). My thesis supervisors were Professor [Jai Sukhatme](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/jai.html) and Professor [Debasis Sengupta](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/dsen.html). A copy of my thesis can be found [here](https://etd.iisc.ac.in/handle/2005/5855). Before beginning my graduate studies, I completed my Master of Technology in ``Climate Science'' from the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/) from 2013 to 2015 and Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India](https://www.heritageit.edu/) from 2006 to 2010. 

I have worked as a software engineer for 3 years at [Wipro Technologies, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, India](https://www.wipro.com/) from 2010 to 2013.
