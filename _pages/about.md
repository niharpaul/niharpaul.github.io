My name is Nihar Paul. Currently, I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [department of aerospace engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India](https://ae.iitm.ac.in/) working with Professor [Manikandan Mathur](https://sites.google.com/site/mathur2m/home). The present area of research deals with lagrangian coherent structures and internal waves. I completed my Ph.D. on September 2022 from the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/). My thesis supervisors were Professor [Jai Sukhatme](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/jai.html) and Professor [Debasis Sengupta](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/dsen.html). A copy of my thesis can be found [here](https://etd.iisc.ac.in/handle/2005/5855). My work and research interests primarily focus on understanding the dynamics of mesoscale eddies, application of non-linear dynamics in the context of geophysical flows, air-sea interaction, shallow water equation, rotating and stratified turbulence, and Ocean-modeling. Prior to completing my graduate studies, I completed my Master of Technology in Climate Science from the [Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, India](https://caos.iisc.ac.in/) and Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India](https://www.heritageit.edu/). I have worked as a software engineer for 3 years in [Wipro Technologies, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, India](https://www.wipro.com/). 

Personal background

So far, I have been busy with my graduate studies, and I firmly believe in contributing to the open-source software community. Some of the coding language I am very much familar with is Matlab, Python, C and Fortran. I will start contributing to my GitHub pages soon.
